    "description": "<p>LunIR (Lunar InfraRed imaging) is a 6U CubeSat that will be deployed from the SLS on Artemis-1. LunIR is a NextSTEP partnership between NASA and Lockheed Martin. The primary payload is a miniature high temperature Mid-Wave Infra-Red (MWIR) sensor. Key technology elements of the MWIR sensor are an integrated micro-cryocooler and a high temperature nBn based 1-Megapixel focal plane.  The spacecraft utilizes 3D printed components. The 6U bus assembly is designed and built as a commercial CubeSat for deep space operation.  Mission data will be analyzed for extensibility and application toward NASA lunar, Mars, and deep space Strategic Knowledge Gaps</p> ",
    "benefits": "<p>LunIR will demonstrate a commercial CubeSat bus operation in deep space.  The very low size, weight and power (SWAP) technologies demonstrated on the LunIR mission - mid-wave infrared sensor, micro-cryocooler, deep space CubeSat relative navigation, 3-D printed components - will provide pathfinder flight demonstration for NASA and the commercial CubeSat industry.  Mission data will be analyzed for extensibility and application toward NASA lunar, Mars and deep space Strategic Knowledge Gaps.</p> ",
